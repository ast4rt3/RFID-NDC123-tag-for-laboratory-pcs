## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/RFID-NDC123-tag-for-laboratory-pc.git
cd RFID-NDC123-tag-for-laboratory-pc
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
cd client
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database

- Start XAMPP and launch phpMyAdmin.
- Import the provided database schema (see /server/db.sql or your own schema file).
- Ensure the database name is juglone (or update in server/server.js).

## Configuration
 
 ### Server
 - Edit database credentials in server/server.js if needed.

 #### To start the server
 ```
node server/server.js
```

 ### Client
 - On first run, the client will prompt for the server IP.
 - You can find the clients ip if you run 
     ``` ipconfig```
     on any CLI
 - Or, manually edit client/config.json (see README-CONFIG.md):

 ```
 {
  "serverIP": "192.168.1.100",
  "serverPort": 8080
}
```
---
## Troubleshooting
- ### Cannot connect to server:
     - Check server IP and port in ```config.json.```
     - Ensure server is running and firewall allows ports 3000 (API) and 8080 (WebSocket).
- ### Database errors:
     - Verify MySQL is running and credentials are correct.
     - Check that the ```juglone``` database and required tables exist.
- ### Client not logging:
     - Check ```rfid-client-debug.log``` for errors
     - Ensure Node.js and Electron are installed.

## Development 
- client code: ```client/```
- server code: ```server/```
- Configuration: ```client/config.js```, ```client/README-CONFIG.md```
- Main entry points:
     - Client: ```client/main.js```
     - Server: ```server/server.js```

## Useful-Commands

#### Starting Server

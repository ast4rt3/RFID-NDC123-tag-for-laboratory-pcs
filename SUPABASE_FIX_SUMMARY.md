# Supabase Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
Data was being saved to the local SQLite database but not being sent to Supabase, even though `DB_TYPE=supabase` was set in the `.env` file.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Environment Variable Name Mismatch
- **Issue**: The `.env` file used `SUPABASE_KEY` but the code expected `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Impact**: Supabase client couldn't authenticate
- **Fix**: Changed `.env` to use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 2. Database Type Not Checked
- **Issue**: The `Database` class in `server/database.js` was hardcoded to use SQLite (`this.type = 'sqlite'`)
- **Impact**: The `DB_TYPE` environment variable was completely ignored
- **Fix**: Modified the constructor to read `process.env.DB_TYPE` and initialize the appropriate database client

### 3. Missing Supabase Integration
- **Issue**: Even though `SupabaseDB` class existed, it was never instantiated
- **Impact**: All database operations went to SQLite regardless of configuration
- **Fix**: Updated `Database.init()` to check `DB_TYPE` and instantiate `SupabaseDB` when configured for Supabase

## Changes Made

### 1. `.env` File
```diff
- SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
+ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 2. `server/database.js`
- Added `require('dotenv').config()` to load environment variables
- Changed constructor to read `DB_TYPE` from environment: `this.type = process.env.DB_TYPE || 'sqlite'`
- Updated `init()` method to:
  - Check if `DB_TYPE === 'supabase'`
  - Instantiate `SupabaseDB` class when using Supabase
  - Fall back to SQLite if Supabase initialization fails
- Updated all database methods to handle Supabase:
  - `insertTimeLog()` - Added Supabase branch
  - `insertAppUsageLog()` - Added Supabase branch
  - `getTimeLogs()` - Added Supabase branch

### 3. `server/supabase-client.js`
- Modified `insertAppUsageLog()` to conditionally include `gpu_percent` for better compatibility

### 4. `check-supabase.js`
- Fixed to use `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` instead of `SUPABASE_KEY`

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Server Logs
When you start the server, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Using Supabase database
‚úÖ Database connection successful
```

Instead of:
```
‚úÖ Using SQLite database at: ...
```

### 2. Test Supabase Connection
```bash
node check-supabase.js
```

Expected output:
```
üîç Checking Supabase configuration...
URL: https://uxhefdybgjluzkbodryd.supabase.co
Key exists: true
‚úÖ time_logs table exists
‚úÖ app_usage_logs table exists
```

### 3. Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Table Editor" in the left menu
4. Select `time_logs` or `app_usage_logs` table
5. You should see new records appearing when clients are connected

### 4. Monitor Real-Time Data
When a client connects and sends data, you should see in the server logs:
```
‚úÖ Time log saved: { id: 123, pc_name: 'PC_NAME', ... }
‚úÖ App usage log saved: { id: 456, app_name: 'Visual Studio Code', ... }
```

## Configuration Options

### Use Supabase (Cloud Database)
```env
DB_TYPE=supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### Use SQLite (Local Database)
```env
DB_TYPE=sqlite
```

Or simply remove the `DB_TYPE` variable (SQLite is the default).

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing Supabase credentials" Error
**Solution**: Make sure your `.env` file has both `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set correctly.

### Issue: "Supabase connection failed" Error
**Solution**: 
1. Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
2. Check that your Supabase project is active
3. Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) policies allow inserts

### Issue: Data still going to SQLite
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure `DB_TYPE=supabase` is set in `.env`
2. Restart the server after changing `.env`
3. Check server logs to confirm it says "Using Supabase database"

### Issue: "Could not find the 'gpu_percent' column" Error
**Solution**: This has been fixed. The code now conditionally includes `gpu_percent` only when it's available.

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ‚úÖ Supabase connection successful
- ‚úÖ Time logs inserted successfully
- ‚úÖ App usage logs inserted successfully
- ‚úÖ Data retrieval working
- ‚úÖ Fallback to SQLite working if Supabase fails

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the server** to apply the changes
2. **Connect a client** to test real-world data flow
3. **Monitor Supabase dashboard** to confirm data is being saved
4. **Optional**: Add the `gpu_percent` column to Supabase if you want to track GPU usage:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE app_usage_logs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gpu_percent REAL;
   ```

## Summary

The Supabase integration is now fully functional. Data will be sent to Supabase when `DB_TYPE=supabase` is configured in the `.env` file. The system also includes automatic fallback to SQLite if Supabase is unavailable, ensuring the application continues to work even if there are connectivity issues.
